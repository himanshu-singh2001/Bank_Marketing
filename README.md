In this project I have analysed the data of a bank to get the insight about the factors affecting the chances of accepting the offer by people to deposit money in bank when they are contacted by Bank.
I have used different models to predict the probability of acceptance of the offer by a customer regarding money deposition.
Models that I have used are Logistic regression, SVM, Decision tree, Random Forest, KNN, Xgboost.
