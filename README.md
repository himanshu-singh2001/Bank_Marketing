In this project I have analysed the data of a bank to get the insight about the factor affecting the chances of people accepting to deposit money their bank when they are contacted.

I have used different models to predict the probability of acceptance of the offer by a customer regarding money deposition.
Models that I have are Logistic regression, SVM, Decision tree, Random Forest, KNN, Xgboost.
